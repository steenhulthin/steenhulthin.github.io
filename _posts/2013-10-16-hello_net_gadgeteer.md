Hello .net Gadgeteer
====================

Not too long ago I bought a [FEZ Cerberus Tinker Kit](https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/455) and a few extra modules. Just for fun and to see if the kids would find that interesting. The Fez Cerberus Tinker Kit contains a [.net gadgeteer](http://www.netmf.com/gadgeteer/) mainboard and some modules. .net gadgeteer is a system in the same ballpark as the [arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [netduino](http://netduino.com/). The gadgeteer system has a bit more horsepower compared to the arduino.

If you haven't heard about it you can get an idea about it from listening to this [Dot Net Rocks podcast episode](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=888).

To get started with using the Gadgeteer system I'll be creating a series of [github](https://github.com) source code repositories with very simple "hello world" applications using a gadgeteer mainboard, a connector to the PC and (mostly) one more module.

I put a video on Youtube of the result.

The first repository is showing [how to use the mainboard led](https://github.com/steenhulthin/HelloFezCerberus#hellofezcerberus).
