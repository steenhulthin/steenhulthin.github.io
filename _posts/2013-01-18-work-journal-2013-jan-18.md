# Work Journal 2013-jan-18

Today I wrapped up the project I am working on for test release. There are still a few features which are not implemented yet, but basic functionality is working. The layout also still needs some love. At this point I'm fairly satisfied with what I have done so far. Well, considering that this was my first web project (beyond 'hello web'-ish) and that I had very little experience with html, css and javascript before I started. 
My temporary colleague, Lars, did most of the backend (database work and services), so I didn't do much there (except for the initial part of the project), which on the good side allowed me to focus almost exclusively on the frontend. 
In my opinion the project as a whole still suffers from the fact that the customer is not the end user, but I hope it will still be useful for the end users after all.

Today was the day the a understood that <a href="http://dev.openlayers.org/docs/files/OpenLayers/BaseTypes/LonLat-js.html">Openlayers.LonLat</a> in <a href="//Openlayers.org">Openlayers</a> is really just a very bad name for a set of x,y-coordinates. Thanks to @tmcw - read more in the <em>LonLat is not Longitude Latitude</em> section of <a href="http://macwright.org/2012/01/12/openlayers.html">this blog post</a>.

Another Openlayers gotcha I ran into today was that projection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_coordinate_system">geographical coordinate system</a> to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection">projected coordinate system</a> requires <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/">proj4js</a>. 

A few <a href="//gis.stackexchange.com">gis.stackexchange.com</a> that helped me in the right direction: 
<a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/20482/openlayers-transform-epsg-27700-coordinate-to-google-900913">http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/20482/openlayers-transform-epsg-27700-coordinate-to-google-900913</a>
<a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/how-do-i-include-proj4js-in-openlayers">http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/how-do-i-include-proj4js-in-openlayers</a>

I ended up only adding the necessary projections and definition to my Scripts folder and not the whole proj4js library. Like this:

<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/scripts_folder1.png" alt="scripts_folder" width="255" height="415" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-279" />

Due to some problem with projections/definition not being ready when the javascript started executing (<a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/11857/proj4js-objects-not-readytouse">I appear not to be alone on this.</a>) my script loading ended up with projections and definition loaded with the rest of the scripts: 

{% highlight html %}
    <script src="Scripts/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/proj4js.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/projcode/tmerc.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/projcode/merc.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/projcode/utm.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/defs/EPSG25832.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/openlayers/OpenLayers.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/bredbaandskortet_config.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/bredbaandskortet.mobile.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
