#Work Journal - What Work/Programming Related Did I Learn Today?

As an experiment I am writing a work journal every (work) day. I'll mainly write about stuff I have learned so the content will be tips and tricks that the future me might find useful. I'll put it on my blog in the hope that sometimes I might have learned something that could be useful to others as well. The work journal will be categories under [work journal][1].
