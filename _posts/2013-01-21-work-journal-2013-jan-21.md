# Work Journal 2013-jan-21

Today some colleagues an I will meet with the customer to find out how things should be tested. Well shouldn't that be done in the beginning of the project you may ask. Oh, yes, I think you are right. So one of the joys of being a contract worker is that you get to bitch about all the things you think are wrong in the process/project. "Did you bitched about the project?" Check.

Anyway, it will probably work out fine and taking into account the general value to the world of the project it is most likely just fine.

Meeting went well. The customer now has a test site to pound on. 

Other than that not much happened today. Had some issues with <a href="http://geoserver.org/">geoserver 2.2.2</a> running on <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat 7.0.34</a> (on windows 7). But that remains unsolved until tomorrow at least.
