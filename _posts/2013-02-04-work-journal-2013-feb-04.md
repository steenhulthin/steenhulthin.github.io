<h2>Cloud email - with Amazon SES</h2>
<p>
Finishing of a contract is always nice. Now on to setting up email sending for an old project. I decided to look at the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/">amazon email service (SES)</a> offering since I'm hosting almost all of the system on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" >EC2</a> presently. 

It seems like using amazon SES is much easier than I had hoped for. When you sign up for SES you get access to a sandboxed version, but getting production access takes about one day - according to Amazon - in my case it was a matter of a couple of hours. 

I didn't get the prototype code up and running yet, but I belive I have what I need to make it work. <a href="http://tekaris.com">This (sorry - broken link, I havn't been able to find it.)</a> blogpost is pretty much what you need to know to get going it seems. Just use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpclient.aspx">.NET SmtpClient class</a> to send the emails to the SES endpoint. We'll see tomorrow if it is really that easy.
