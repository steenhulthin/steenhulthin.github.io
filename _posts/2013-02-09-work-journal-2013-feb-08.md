<h2>A Bug From the Past</h2>
<p>
Well it happens. Your test code runs fine, but when you run the full system it crashes. The email integration I have been working on the last couple of days is the kind of legacy code that I created myself. It is the first "full" system I built (really I was seriously a junior at that time, but very keen on learning and doing this "right") and actually I'm content with it. Anyway part of what I added is the code I wrote about a <a href="/blog/work-journal-2013-feb-05/">few days ago</a>. It turns out that the code has a problem. Here's the relevant code: 
[csharp]
public void Send(string fromEmail, string toEmails,
	string emailSubject, string emailBody,
		string attachmentPath )
{
	var mail = new MailMessage(fromEmail,
		toEmails.Replace(';', ','))
	{
		SubjectEncoding = Encoding.UTF8,
		Subject = emailSubject,
		BodyEncoding = Encoding.UTF8,
		Body = emailBody,
		Attachments = {new Attachment(attachmentPath)}
	};
	_smtpClient.Send(mail);
}
[/csharp]
When the email has been sent the file that was sent as the attachment is deleted from the disk. When I tested the code in the full running system it turns out that the deletion failed. The problem is that <code>MailMessage</code> keeps the reference to the attached file. Oops. <code>MailMessage</code> is IDisposable, so really I should have wrapped it in a using block anyway. 
[csharp]
public void Send(string fromEmail, string toEmails, 
	string emailSubject, string emailBody, 
		string attachmentPath )
{

	using (var mail = new MailMessage(fromEmail, 
		toEmails.Replace(';', ','))
	{
		SubjectEncoding = Encoding.UTF8,
		Subject = emailSubject,
		BodyEncoding = Encoding.UTF8,
		Body = emailBody,
		Attachments = {new Attachment(attachmentPath)}
	})
	{
		_smtpClient.Send(mail);
	}
}
[/csharp]
and there was much rejoicing.

<h2>Testing in "Production" with AWS</h2>
<p>
I really like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> as production environment. Not just because [insert the usual cloud buzz words], but because it allows me to clone the production machines, launch the clones, deploy new features on the clones, swap IPs and then test on a setup that is exactly like the production system (when the new features have been deployed). That's what I did today - testing on the "production" system and fixed the bug.
