# NordicJs 2014 - day 1

[NordicJs](http://nordicjs.com/) is a JavaScript (**surprise!**) conference held in beautiful [Stockholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm). I couldn't attend in person, but NordicJs offered a free livestream from the event. I think that is just fantastic for the community and since the event was sold out I don't it had much (negative) impact on the conference economy. 

## Livestreaming and SilverLight

However the livestream was the nest of a bit controversy. The livestream required SilverLight to work from a desktop machine and there were quite a few frustrated tweets about this. 

Here's a polite and reasonable example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Aaaargh, vi får inte igång livesändningen. Är vi ensamma om detta? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nordicjs?src=hash">#nordicjs</a></p>&mdash; W4 (@webbfyra) <a href="https://twitter.com/webbfyra/status/512517208900403200">September 18, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people (including [@webbfyra](http://twitter.com/webbfyra/))got it working by installing SilverLight I believe (judging from tweets.). 

Off course it is a bit ironic that a JavaScript conference needs Silverlight. NordicJs had worked with [Viasat](http://www.viasat.se/) to provide the live stream, so it was no really NordicJs's fault.
