# Leetspeak 2015

This year it was the fourth public [Leetspeak](http://leetspeak.se/) conference. As the three times before the Leetspeak of this year was held at a very nice conference room. Really beautiful this year - actually the most beautiful conference room I have ever seen. The Venue was at the [Berns](http://www.berns.se/en/mote-event/) in central Stockholm. 

Last time Leetspeak was in Stockholm I made it into a family trip, but this time it was just hard on business for me. Really I would have liked to do the same this time too, but I didn't get this organised in time and then I even had the flu in the week before the conference.

## Talks

Just like last year there were six talk - all in one track. Even though this is quite intense it still works well. 

## Intro

Holding our conference attendee hands were [Martin Mazur](https://twitter.com/m_mazur) from Tretton37. As always a short and sweet introduction was given. I noticed that this year Leetspeak explicitly announced a `code of conduct`. Good idea.

## IOT and economy

[Clements Vasters](https://twitter.com/clemensv) talked about the general state and future of [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things). Clements didn't go into technical details, but kept the talk focused on the economy driving the development in IoT. In Clements opinion currently people safety and insurance economy is where the money is in IoT, not in funny/cool/nerdy home gadgets.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/clemensv">@clemensv</a> about the Internet of things and the possibilities it brings at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a></p>&mdash; Bj√∂rn Hedelund (@bhedelund) <a href="https://twitter.com/bhedelund/status/652759516631703552">October 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

## Frankenmonster coding

* 

## Home automation

* changing interfaces
* own hardware


## Going beyond OWASP

The first speaker was [Barry Dorrans](https://twitter.com/blowdart) who works at
Microsoft's asp.net team on security. Barry's talk was very entertaining, but 
still full of very usefull information - even for developers outside the .net stack. 

The talk assumed a fair bit of security knowledge on .net, but in turn many 
interesting topics very covered in hour Barry was on the stage. 

Barry showed these three security bulletins:

* [Hash DoS via form posting](http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/huge-portions-of-web-vulnerable-to-hashing-denial-of-service-attack/)
* [Padding Oracle attack](http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/)
* [SharePoint Viewstate Remote Code Execution](http://threatpost.com/critical-sharepoint-bulletin-top-priority-on-patch-tuesday) - ViewState MAC must ALWAYS be (left) ON (on all pages) - SharePoint didn't do this >< . 

And several other demos. One of the showed why using partial trust is no longer recommended (see the presentation 1:09). 

A couple of tweets related to this talk:

## Testing the essential with Autofixture

[Enrico Campidoglio](https://twitter.com/ecampidoglio) is a good presenter 
(I know from previous talks I have seen with him)  and this is what the 
attendees said about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ecampidoglio">@ecampidoglio</a> is presenting an entertaining <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a> session.

I missed this talk because I chose to set up my coffee measuring device and followed the "hallway track". 

## Making Games with Unity in C#

[Adam Buckner](https://twitter.com/theantranch) did a polished and solid tutorial/product presentation of the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game creation tools. 

Although the talk technically was good there is an inherent problem with product presentations. The problem is that the main purpose of such a talk is marketing.

In my opinion product talks are best if they lean towards case studies. A product presentation will most likely interest me far less than a talk about how a specific project (game) was created with that product (praticularly if it also shows some limitations of the product). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Pretty interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity3D?src=hash">#Unity3D</a> session by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAntRanch">@TheAntRanch</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a>.

## Building backend services at Spotify

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)'s approach development and operation is 
really interesting. Not only because [Niklas Gustavsson](https://twitter.com/protocol7))
presented really well, but mainly bacause Spotify use techiniques that most 
companies can learn from. 

The talk contained: 

- real setup used in the trenches at Spotify
- architecture at spotify (incl. organisational)
- the Spotify approach to microservices
- automated deployment and configuration - how Spotify handles configuring and 
 managing servers automatically.
- An honest statement about monitoring 'getting better' (that the monitoring 
is not good enough yet basically.)

A very good talk definately worth seeing. Compliments [Fred George microservices talk](http://vimeo.com/79866979) for last years Oredev.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Really impressed at how spotify is built.

## What is DevOps and how can it help my business succeed?

[Paul Stack](https://twitter.com/stack72) delivered a very polished talk on devops. If you haven't heard much about the topic this talk is one to watch. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>&quot;DevOps is about Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72">@stack72</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a></p>&mdash; Mikael Brassman (@spoike) <a href="https://twitter.com/spoike/status/518400898494906369">October 4, 2014</a></blockquote>

One point that about a really nice automatic deployment deployment pipeline was summarized by @MrowcaKasia :

## The art of destroying software

This talk was not the classical conference talk. 
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) held a 45 minutes monolog with 
a clear points (and a few rethorical questions to prove the points). 

The ideas were fairly simple
* optimize for delting code. Never make 'unit' (microservices, objects, actors)
of code that take more than a week to write. 
* write composable code at all levels (relatively large systems should be composed 
of (relatively) smaller systems - and so on.)
* Write the software in the simplest way that could possibly work right now (not
adding stuff that will (or will not) be needed in the future.)

In a conversation after the conference one person mentioned that the reason 
for optimizing for deletion was fairly clear, but not how. 

I quite liked the monolog format, but the above leads me to believe that the 
talk could be improved, but having the dialog for 1/2 hour and then another 1/2 
hour or so on examples of code where 'deletability' and composability was achieved.

The crowd said: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregyoung">@gregyoung</a> making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a> feel like a cozy storytelling session.

## My own micro contribution to Leetspeak

In addition to attending I also brought a silly little gadget that was build using the presents from previous Leetspeak conferences - a cup and a raspberry pi - lego and a few electronic components. 

I presented this in the breaks and it was a lot of fun. I was happy that so many student came and talked to me. Several of them told me that they used [arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)s in their studies. 

I'll probably make a post on the gadget at some point, but here's a picture of it:

## Postconference

After the conference everybody was invited to mingle at a pub. Good idea and I went for a while until I had to leave to catch the train home - tired and happy about what I had learned. 

Everybody seemed to have a good time after I left- here one example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Nancy team caught on secret meeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a> after party. <a href="http://t.co/uBP6rakILR">pic.twitter.com/uBP6rakILR</a></p>&mdash; Deniz Yildirim (@Yildirim_Deniz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Yildirim_Deniz/status/518488377386344448">October 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The day after I saw this tweet: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>To the person who stole my MacBook at the bar last night. Haha. Good joke. Now please return it.</p>&mdash; Anders Ljusberg (@CodingInsomnia) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodingInsomnia/status/518682979640811520">October 5, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Ouch... That made me angry on Anders's behalf. And as you may have guessed this was the after conference drama I talked about. I don't think Anders got his laptop back. 

This was my only experience related to the conference that was not good. 

## All-in-all

Leetspeak is a really good conference that I would highly recommend to anyone developing on the .net stack. The team at Tretton37 does a great job arranging - a big thanks to all of them. 

If you couldn't go or if you would like to see the talks again they are all available here: <http://vimeo.com/user14410096/videos> (including talks from previous years).

See you next time for Leetspeak 2015!
