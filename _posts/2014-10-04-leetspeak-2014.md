# Leetspeak 2014

Leetspeak is a really nice one-day, one-track saturday conference arranged by [tretton37](http://tretton37.com/). 2014 was the 3rd year it was held (with public access anyway). This year's conference was in [Göteborg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg) - the second largest city in Sweden. 

I attended the two first years, so I thought it would be natural to attend again even though the location meant that I would either be late or had to sleep in Göteborg the night before the conference. Luckily I decided to go there on friday, but more on that later. 

The two previous years I didn't notice any drama and this year was no different, except for a little before and unluckily a bit more after the conference. 

The drama before was really not much to talk about but it did affect one of the speakers - Barry Dorrans. His plane was initially delayed and later cancelled. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So yea not flying <a href="https://twitter.com/Delta">@delta</a> again. Making us sit planned only to realize they didn&#39;t have the necessary 3rd pilot? What a joke.</p>&mdash; Barry Dorrans (@blowdart) <a href="https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/517596338012569600">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

But he did arrive and all was good(-ish).

## Talks

There were six talk, which I think is the absolute maximum a conference should allow. Making sure that there is room for breaks and mingling is very important in my opinion. Even though the schedule was tight I think it worked well. 

## Intro

[Martin Mazur](https://twitter.com/m_mazur) from Tretton37 made a short introduction to the conference and talked about learning and why it's particularly important developers.

## Going beyond OWASP

The first speaker was [Barry Dorrans](https://twitter.com/blowdart) who works at
Microsoft's asp.net team on security. Barry's talk was very entertaining, but 
still full of very usefull information - even for developers outside the .net stack. 

The talk assumed a fair bit of security knowledge on .net, but in turn many 
interesting topics very covered in hour Barry was on the stage. 

Barry showed these three security bulletins:

* [Hash DoS via form posting](http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/12/huge-portions-of-web-vulnerable-to-hashing-denial-of-service-attack/)
* [Padding Oracle attack](http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/)
* [SharePoint Viewstate Remote Code Execution](http://threatpost.com/critical-sharepoint-bulletin-top-priority-on-patch-tuesday) - ViewState MAC must ALWAYS be (left) ON (on all pages) - SharePoint didn't do this >< . 

And several other demos. One of the showed why using partial trust is no longer recommended (see the presentation 1:09). 

A couple of tweets related to this talk:

## Testing the essential with Autofixture

[Enrico Campidoglio](https://twitter.com/ecampidoglio) is a good presenter 
(I know from previous talks I have seen with him)  and this is what the 
attendees said about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ecampidoglio">@ecampidoglio</a> is presenting an entertaining <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a> session.

I missed this talk because I chose to set up my coffee measuring device and followed the "hallway track". 

## Making Games with Unity in C#

[Adam Buckner](https://twitter.com/theantranch) did a polished and solid tutorial/product presentation of the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game creation tools. 

Although the talk technically was good there is an inherent problem with product presentations. The problem is that the main purpose of such a talk is marketing.

In my opinion product talks are best if they lean towards case studies. A product presentation will most likely interest me far less than a talk about how a specific project (game) was created with that product (praticularly if it also shows some limitations of the product). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Pretty interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity3D?src=hash">#Unity3D</a> session by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAntRanch">@TheAntRanch</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a>.

## Building backend services at Spotify

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)'s approach development and operation is 
really interesting. Not only because [Niklas Gustavsson](https://twitter.com/protocol7))
presented really well, but mainly bacause Spotify use techiniques that most 
companies can learn from. 

The talk contained: 
* real setup used in the trenches at Spotify
* architecture at spotify (incl. organisational)
* the Spotify approach to microservices
* automated deployment and configuration - how Spotify handles configuring and 
 managing servers automatically.
* An honest statement about monitoring 'getting better' (that the monitoring 
is not good enough yet basically.)

A very good talk definately worth seeing. Compliments [Fred George microservices talk](http://vimeo.com/79866979) for last years Oredev.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Really impressed at how spotify is built.

## What is DevOps and how can it help my business succeed?

[Paul Stack](https://twitter.com/stack72) delivered a very polished talk on devops. If you haven't heard much about the topic this talk is one to watch. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>&quot;DevOps is about Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72">@stack72</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a></p>&mdash; Mikael Brassman (@spoike) <a href="https://twitter.com/spoike/status/518400898494906369">October 4, 2014</a></blockquote>

One point that about a really nice automatic deployment deployment pipeline was summarized by @MrowcaKasia :

## The art of destroying software

This talk was not the classical conference talk. 
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) held a 45 minutes monolog with 
a clear points (and a few rethorical questions to prove the points). 

The ideas were fairly simple
* optimize for delting code. Never make 'unit' (microservices, objects, actors)
of code that take more than a week to write. 
* write composable code at all levels (relatively large systems should be composed 
of (relatively) smaller systems - and so on.)
* Write the software in the simplest way that could possibly work right now (not
adding stuff that will (or will not) be needed in the future.)

In a conversation after the conference one person mentioned that the reason 
for optimizing for deletion was fairly clear, but not how. 

I quite liked the monolog format, but the above leads me to believe that the 
talk could be improved, but having the dialog for 1/2 hour and then another 1/2 
hour or so on examples of code where 'deletability' and composability was achieved.

The crowd said: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregyoung">@gregyoung</a> making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leetspeak?src=hash">#leetspeak</a> feel like a cozy storytelling session.
