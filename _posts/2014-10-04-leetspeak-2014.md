# Leetspeak 2014



# Talks

## Intro

[Martin Mazur](https://twitter.com/m_mazur/media)

* history of leetspeak
* learning

## Going beyond OWASP

The first speaker was [Barry Dorrans](https://twitter.com/blowdart) who works at
Microsoft's asp.net team on security. Barry's talk was very entertaining, but 
still full of very usefull information even for developers not on the .net stack. 

The talk assumed a fair bit of security knowledge on .net, but in turn many 
interesting topics very covered in hour Barry was on the stage. 

A very good talk. 

* war stories from asp security team
* examples
    * viewstate mac
    * don't use: 
        * partial trust

## Testing the essential with Autofixture

[Enrico Campidoglio](https://twitter.com/ecampidoglio) is a good presenter 
(I know from previous talks I have seen with him)  and this is what the 
attendees said about it:

I missed this talk because I chose to set up my coffee measuring device and
followed the "hallway track". 

## Making Games with Unity in C#

[Adam Buckner](https://twitter.com/theantranch) did a polished and solid tutorial/product 
presentation of the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game creation tools. 

Although the talk technically was good there is an inherent problem with product
presentations. The problem is that the main purpose of such a talk is marketing.

In my opinion product talks are best if they lean towards case studies. A product
 presentation will most likely interest me far less than a talk about how a specific
 project (game) was created with that product (praticularly if it also shows 
some limitations of the product). 



## Building backend services at Spotify

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)'s approach development and operation is 
really interesting. Not only because [Niklas Gustavsson](https://twitter.com/protocol7))
presented really well, but mainly bacause Spotify use techiniques that most 
companies can learn from. 

The talk contained: 
* real setup used in the trenches at Spotify
* architecture at spotify (incl. organisational)
* the Spotify approach to microservices
* automated deployment and configuration - how Spotify handles configuring and 
 managing servers automatically.
* An honest statement about monitoring 'getting better' (that the monitoring 
is not good enough yet basically.)

A very good talk definately worth seeing. Compliments Fred George 
microservices talk for last years Oredev.

## What is DevOps and how can it help my business succeed?

[Paul Stack](https://twitter.com/stack72)

* devops
* "devops is not a job title"

## The art of destroying software

This talk was not the classical conference talk. 
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) held a 45 minutes monolog with 
a clear points (and a few rethorical questions to prove the points). 

The ideas were fairly simple
* optimize for delting code. Never make 'unit' (microservices, objects, actors)
of code that take more than a week to write. 
* write composable code at all levels (relatively large systems should be composed 
of (relatively) smaller systems - and so on.)
* Write the software in the simplest way that could possibly work right now (not
adding stuff that will (or will not) be needed in the future.)

In a conversation after the conference one person mentioned that the reason 
for optimizing for deletion was fairly clear, but not how. 

I quite liked the monolog format, but the above leads me to believe that the 
talk could be improved, but having the dialog for 1/2 hour and then another 1/2 
hour or so on examples of code where 'deletability' and composability was achieved.
