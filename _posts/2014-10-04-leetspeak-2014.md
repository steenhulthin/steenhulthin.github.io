## The art of destroying software

This talk was not the classical conference talk. 
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) held a 45 minutes monolog with 
a clear points (and a few rethorical questions to prove the points). 

The ideas were fairly simple
* optimize for delting code. Never make 'unit' (microservices, objects, actors)
of code that take more than a week to write. 
* write composable code at all levels (relatively large systems should be composed 
of (relatively) smaller systems - and so on.)
* Write the software in the simplest way that could possibly work right now (not
adding stuff that will (or will not) be needed in the future.)

In a conversation after the conference one person mentioned that the reason 
for optimizing for deletion was fairly clear, but not how. 

I quite liked the monolog format, but the above leads me to believe that the 
talk could be improved, but having the dialog for 1/2 hour and then another 1/2 
hour or so on examples of code where 'deletability' and composability was achieved.

The crowd said:
