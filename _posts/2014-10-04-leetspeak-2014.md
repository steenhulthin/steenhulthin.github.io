## The art of destroying software

This talk was not the classical conference talk. 
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung) held a 45 minutes monolog with 
a clear points (and a few rethorical questions to prove the points). 

The ideas were fairly simple
* optimize for delting code. Never make 'unit' (microservices, objects, actors)
of code that take more than a week to write. 
* write composable code at all levels (relatively large systems should be composed 
of (relatively) smaller systems - and so on.)
