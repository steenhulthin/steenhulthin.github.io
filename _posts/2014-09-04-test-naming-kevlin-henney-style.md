# Test Naming - Kevlin Henney Style

Naming tests is hard. For [unit test beginners I have recommended](http://steenhulthin.github.io/CircleCalculation/#7 "Link to my beginner's unit test course in Danish") [Roy Osherove's naming](http://osherove.com/blog/2005/4/3/naming-standards-for-unit-tests.html) until now. 

Here's an example:


It is an easy way get started with testing without having the naming of the tests getting in the way. In the beginning just writing the test is hard enough already. However recently I saw another way of naming that might be easy enough for even beginners.

I saw this other way of naming in the talk "Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers" by [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney "Kevlin Henney on Twitter") from the NDC 2014 conference. I really recommend that talk and it's available at <http://vimeo.com/97329157>. If you just want to see the part about test naming skip to 58:48, but you should really watch it all if you have the time.
