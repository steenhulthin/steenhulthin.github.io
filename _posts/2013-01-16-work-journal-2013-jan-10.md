<h2>Javascript is hard!</h2>
<em>or maybe just different.</em>

Although I spend most the of morning trying to figure out have to set a global variable based on a synchronous ajax call in javascript I actually progressed a fair bit on my current project. I most of all learned that there is still really much I don't understand and need to learn about javascript. 
I still don't know why I couldn't make it work. Maybe because a change in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11448011/jquery-ajax-async-deprecated-what-now">jQuery</a>. 
I ended up using the <code>jQuery.getJSON()</code> and just calling all code in the callback that depended on the data I wanted to put in the global variable.

So in stead of 
<code>
<pre>
var globalVariable;

// Following code inside the scope of a closure:
jQuery.ajax({
	url: 'servicehost.net/ressource',
	success: function (result) { 
               globalVariable = result.relavantData; 
        },
	async: false
});
// function calls using globalVariable
</pre> 
</code>
I ended up with 
<code>
<pre>
// Following code inside the scope of a closure:
jQuery.getJSON( 'servicehost.net/ressource', function (result) { 
		var localVariable = result.relavantData; 
		// loads of functioncalls that depend on localVariable
	}
});  
</pre> 
</code>

Probably what I ended up with is a better pattern anyway.
