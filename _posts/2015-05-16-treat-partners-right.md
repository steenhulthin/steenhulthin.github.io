#How (lack of) business ethics cost money?

This post is not a (for me) typical technical post. This post is about how a large engineering company potentially lost an order because they lost the trust of a subcontractor. The story is no a random story that I heard about - I was the subcontractor. 

#Start

- [ ] the work
- [ ] the agreements/contract (time and materials)
- [ ] the long period of nothings wrong

#Accounting

- [ ] accounting and finding the missing payment - How I failed.
- [ ] radio silence
- [ ] Pay me!
- [ ] We will pay half!
- [ ] pay me!
- [ ] reminder
- [ ] You are so wrong (but we'll pay)

#Personal lessons learned

- [ ] Don't assume your partners will pay what they owe you. Check that they have paid.
- [ ] It is really common for people not to admit mistakes (and try to learn from it) and in stead blame others.

#Status

- [ ] so far no payment - next step: collection - That sucks so much.

# td;dr (executive resume)

If you are in a company don't do anything that makes your relationship to a business partner worse in order to gain a little money. It will most likely cost you much money than you gained over time. Your business partner will loose trust in you and will be more likely to do business with someone else. 

I think this really is general in life. Don't treat other people like shit (even though you are a psychopath) - over time you will be worse off.
