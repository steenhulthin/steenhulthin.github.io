Today I am going to implement a few more features so the solution is ready for testing by the customer. Friday I hope to do some testing and even setup a bit of automated acceptance testing maybe.

Today from the interwebs:

Some things I used to solve some specific problem

<h2>Rounding in javascript</h2>
Rounding in javascript is funny. If you just need a number as a string with a defined number of digits you can use <code>.toFixed()</code>. In pretty much any other case you should probably do something else like <code>Math.round(original*100)/100</code> (for two decimal rounding.). <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/661562/how-to-format-a-float-in-javascript">Here</a> is a bit more discussion on the topic. 

<h2>Positioning a jQueryUI datepicker in relation to its textbox</h2>
By default the datepicker pop up with the left side of the caledar aligned with left side of the textbox. I needed the datepicker moved more to the left. Overriding the default jQueryUI css in my own css fixed that: 

[css]
.ui-datepicker { 
  margin-left: -60px;
}
[/css]

The idea come from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/662220/how-to-change-the-pop-up-position-of-the-jquery-datepicker-control/1346680#1346680">this stackoverflow answer</a>

<h2>Position html element in the bottom</h2>
[css]
{
    bottom: 0;
}
[/css]
That's it. Nothing more to see here. Move along.

<h2>Redirect to mobile site</h2>
Redirecting to a mobile site seems to be a problem than cannot really be solved in any obvious and/or good way. Sniffing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">user agent string</a>, just seems wrong to me. I decided to redirect based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.screen.width">screen width</a> on the client or rather the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.screen.availWidth">available screen width</a>. Well, that's not perfect, but good enough for this solution. 

I ended up with a index.html with the only responsibility of redirecting either to the mobile or "normal" version of the site. It looks like this:

[html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="da">
<head>
    <title>Bredb&aring;ndskortet - Erhvervsstyrelsen</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var mobilesiteLocation = "./m.bredbaandskortet.html";
        var mainsiteLocation = "./bredbaandskortet.html";
        if (screen.availWidth <= 1050 && screen.availWidth <= 1050) { 
			document.location = mobilesiteLocation; 
			} else { 
			document.location = mainsiteLocation; }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
[/html]

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a> has a nice writeup on some advantages and disadvantages of agent sniffing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Development/Mobile/Separate_sites">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Development/Mobile/Separate_sites</a>
Please let me know if you know a good solution to redirection to a mobile version of a site...

Today I also listened to the <a href="http://frompythonimportpodcast.com/">From Python Import podcast</a> and really got excited about <a href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans">python Koans</a>. Will have a look at that.
