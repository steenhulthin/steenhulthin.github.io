#Work journal 2013-jan-09

Today my smallest boy (1 year) and my girlfriend were sick, so I stayed at home working in the breaks between sicksitting. The day started with watching some of Denise Jacobs (twitter: @denisejacobs) video from øredev, while the baby was watching Teletubbies (yay?!): 
<http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/the-art-of-disciplined-creativity> 

Takeaways so far: 

*   Have your workplace be for work and go somewhere else to do things like distraction(twitter and stuff). 
*   Get alpha brain wave going: close your eyes, put your tongue to the roof of your mouth and take a couple of deep breaths

I got map search functionality working on my present project. The setup was based on this example page: 

<http://visstedet.kortforsyningen.dk/trunkImport/VisStedet/trunk/examples/geosearch_map.html>. It works quite well but it based on a paid model. However that is probably about to change: <http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/> (in Danish).

From twitter: @DamianEdwards tweeted how to use a CDN with local fallback. It looks like this: 

`<script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script>
<script>
(window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/scripts/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"><\/script>'));
</script>` I have seen this before but now I actually need it.
