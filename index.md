# Steen Hulthin Rasmussen (home)

I'm a software developer and/or [GIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) dude. My main expertise is working with digital map, spatial data and GIS products at all levels of the technology stack. 

In my work life I'm the CEO/code monkey/Key Account Manager of [Percipio](http://percipio.dk). I have standard [CV available for download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/211064/percipio/CV/cv_steen_hulthin_rasmussen.pdf) with a standard resume of some of the things I have done professionally even though I'm not a big fan of standard CVs. 

[Copenhagen, Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) is my home town. I live there together with my girlfriend and between 1 and 3 children. I really enjoy running, biking and chocolate. I love life.

I'm also a failed chess and guitar player, a [Dane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes) (and actually [half-swedish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedes), thanks to Mom), around 40 (thanks to Mom and Dad), bald (thanks to Dad) and a [chocolate lover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocoholic) (did I mention that already?). 

## The worst/best of me

These are the things I hate most about myself

* The perpetual biting of nails! Stop it!
* That I start 10 code projects and only ship 1. Can You please just finish half?!
* That I can so rarely start anything without first procrastinating.

These are the things I love most about myself: 

* I'm so incredibly lucky. Not in games and such, but where it really matters: I have never had to starve, never seen a war, I'm healthy and so are my children, I can afford all I really need and I'm a white European male and I even had good childhood and great parents.
* I love that I can make people smile and I don't really care if I'm smiled at or with.
* That I still what to improve and what to learn new things even as a semi-old person as much as I did when I was younger. 

## What I have done all life? 

* Won the Nordic championship in chess for school teams.
* Qualified for the Nordic championship in chess for high school teams.
* Run a marathon.
* Worked as [foreign student 'buddy'](http://www.dtu.dk/english/news/2014/05/welcome-to-denmark!-want-to-be-buddies) coordinator at [the Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](http://www.dtu.dk/english) - hard, but fun. 
* Lived in Thailand for half a year - twice.
* Graduated as an Environmental Engineer.
* [By coincidence become a (untrained) Software Developer](http://steen.hulthin.dk/blog/the-programmer-or-there-and-never-back-again/).
* Run half marathon world championship race more than twice as slow as the winner.

## Community

I feel a part of the global software development community. In my opinion you are a member of a community even if you only "consuming" and not contributing in the a more traditional way. I have presented at a couple of occasions and I regularly contribute. 

I attend conferences regularly. I have been attending [Oredev](http://oredev.org) every year since 2011, [Leetspeak](http://leetspeak.se) since it's start in 2012 and Danish Developer Conference since 2013.

When I have time you can find my at user group meetings, often at [Copenhagen js](http://copenhagenjs.dk/) and [Google Developer Group Copenhagen](https://plus.google.com/113724797202166933848/about)

## Projects

I maintain a few [Open Source Software](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) projects:
 
In the serious catagory are: 

* [MapBasicUnit](http://steenhulthin.github.io/MapBasicUnit/) - A unit testing library for the MapBasic language. [MapBasic](http://www.mapinfo.com/product/mapinfo-mapbasic/) is a language for the desktop GIS [MapInfo](http://www.mapinfo.com/).
* [reStructuredText_NPP](http://steenhulthin.github.io/reStructuredText_NPP/) - Syntax highlighting for [reStructuredText](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) for [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
* [FreeMarker_NPP](http://steenhulthin.github.io/freemarker_NPP/) - Syntax highlighting for the template language [FreeMarker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) for [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

In the mostly for fun category are:

* [The Anti Region Legion](http://anti-region-legion.org) - a coding style movement for a better `C#` world. 
* [LOLCODE_NPP](http://steenhulthin.github.io/LOLCODE_NPP/) - Syntax highlighting for [LOLCODE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE) for [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
* [CollatzConjecture.Net](https://github.com/steenhulthin/CollatzConjecture.Net) - a .net library for calculating solutions to [Collatz Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) problems. 

Besides writing code I also write blog posts. The topic is mostly technical stuff related to software development and/or GIS, but occasionally also about management and team work. You can find my blog on <http://steen.hulthin.dk/blog/>.
