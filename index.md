## work private

I am the CEO/code monkey/janitor of [Percipio](http://percipio.dk). I have standard [CV available for download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/211064/percipio/CV/cv_steen_hulthin_rasmussen.pdf) with a resume of some of the things I have done professionally. 

I live in Copenhagen, Denmark together with my girlfriend and 3 children. I really enjoy running, biking and chocolate. I love life.

### My own worst

These are the things I hate most about myself

* The perpetual biting of nails! Stop it!
* That I start 10 code projects and only ship 1. Can You please just finish half?!
* That I can so rarely start anything with first procrastinating.

These are the things I love most about myself: 

* I'm so incredibly lucky. Not in games and such, but where it really matters: I have never had to starve, never seen a war, I'm healthy and so are my children, I can afford all I really need and I'm a white European male and I even had good childhood and great parents.
* I love that I can make people smile and I don't really care if I'm smiled at or with.
* That I still what to improve and what to learn new things even as a semi-old person as much as I did when I was younger. 

## Community

I feel a part of the software development community. In my opinion you are a member of a community even if you only "consuming" and not contributing in the a more traditional way. I have presented at a couple of occasions. 

I attend conferences regularly. I have been attending [Oredev](http://oredev.org) every year since 2011, [Leetspeak](http://leetspeak.se) since it's start in 2012 and Danish Developer Conference since 2013.

When I have time you can find my at user group meetings, often at [Copenhagen js](http://copenhagenjs.dk/) and [Google Developer Group Copenhagen](https://plus.google.com/113724797202166933848/about)
